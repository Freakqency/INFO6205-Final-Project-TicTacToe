### Menace Tic-Tac-Toe
A web application developed with JavaScript, which supports 3 modes of playing: 

Human VS Menace 

Menace VS Menace 

Menace VS Perfect(Min-Max Approach) 

Matchboxes are populated with a JavaScript Hash equivalent object array, each object holding the series of integers representing the beads. The Menace will be trained based on the outcome of every game and beads and moves will be reflected in the matchboxes. As the game progresses, Menace will be trained more to handle the game scenarios resulting to more Wins or Draws.
